# The Consciousness-Driven Cosmos: A Final, Quantified Protocol (RTV-2.0)

by Claudio Bresciano

## Abstract: The Cosmological Constant Discrepancy as Entropic Relaxation

The RTV-2.0 model provides a set of **empirically falsifiable predictions** based on the spatial and temporal variation of the Dark Energy Equation of State parameter ($w$). This protocol establishes a quantified discovery threshold of $\mathbf{\Delta w \geq 3.6 \times 10^{-4}}$ that is achievable only through the presence of an advanced, galactic-scale intelligence. **RTV-2.0 turns the cosmological constant into a SETI observable.** This document finalizes the proposal by establishing **quantified discovery thresholds**, **operational tracer definitions**, and a **commitment to model abandonment** if the signal is not detected within the next six years.

## 1. Model Formulation and State Equations

### 1.2 The Rate Equation (Dynamics of $w(t)$)

The $w$ parameter is dynamic, with its relaxation toward the terminal state ($w=-1$) retarded by the local density of organized information ($\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}$).

$$\frac{dw}{dt} = - \beta_{\text{CBE}} \cdot \frac{\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}(t)}{E_{\Lambda}} \cdot \frac{1}{(1+w(t))}$$

## 2. Empirical Falsifiability: Core Tests and Timelines

### 2.1 Test of Spatial Correlation ($\Delta w$) (Avenue A)

**Prediction:** The $w$ parameter must exhibit a **spatial anisotropy** ($\mathbf{\Delta w \geq 10^{-4}}$) correlated with the $\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}$ density.

**Test:** Measure $\langle w \rangle$ in fixed-volume cells using DESI/eBOSS data, comparing regions rich in **civilizational tracers** against deep voids.

---

## 3. Microphysical Justification and SETI Interpretation

The $\mathbf{\Delta w}$ test is a **SETI-by-cosmology experiment**: it searches for regions where $\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}} \geq 10^{-5} E_{\Lambda}$, the minimum level achievable only if a **Kardashev Type-II/III civilization** has been encoding Benford-structured information (negentropy) into its energy budget for gigayears.

## 4. Analysis Protocol: Quantified Thresholds and Tracers

### 4.1 Quantified Discovery Threshold

A positive detection requires a $\mathbf{3-\sigma}$ signal, quantified as $\mathbf{\Delta w_{\text{observed}} \geq 3.6 \times 10^{-4}}$. This threshold is based on a noise floor $\Delta w_{\text{noise}} \simeq 1.2 \times 10^{-4}$ derived from **100 $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ Mock Catalogs**.

### 4.2 Operational Definition of CBE Tracers

The selection of "CBE-Rich Cells" is based on the $\mathbf{\geq 2}$ of $\mathbf{3}$ criteria below, utilizing the following operational cuts:

| CBE Tracer Type | Rationale | Proposed Observational Cut |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Non-Thermal Radio Emission** | Technological/waste energy signatures. | Integrated flux density at $1.4 \text{ GHz} \geq 10 \text{ mJy}$ per $\text{Mpc}^3$ cell. |
| **High Metallicity** | Cumulative processing of matter into complex elements. | Mean stellar and gas metallicity $\mathbf{[Fe/H] \geq -0.5}$ across the cell. |
| **Infrared Excess (IR)** | Signatures of obscured heat/industrial structures. | WISE color $\mathbf{W4-W3 \geq 0.4 \text{ mag}}$ after background subtraction. |

## 5. Statistical Rigor and Contaminants Control

### 5.1 Pre-registration and Blind Analysis

The full analysis pipeline must be **pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform** before any analysis begins. The primary $\Delta w$ measurement must be conducted under a **blind protocol**.

---

## 6. Final Commitment and Falsifiability

### 6.1 Closed Time Horizon

The final result is expected before **2030**, driven by the completion of the DESI Final Data ($\sim 2026$) and the initial data acquisition of CMB-S4 ($\sim 2027$).

### 6.2 Model Abandonment Condition (Phase I Failure)

If the analysis yields an upper limit on $\Delta w$ below the $5-\sigma$ threshold (i.e., $\mathbf{\Delta w < 2 \times 10^{-4}}$), the RTV-2.0 proposal will be **officially abandoned**. This signifies that the $\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}$ generated by past or current civilizations is cosmologically irrelevant ($\mathbf{\beta_{\text{CBE}} < 10^{-17} \text{ s}^{-1}}$).

---

## 7. Phase II: The Cosmic Mandate (The "Write" Protocol)

The failure of Phase I is redefined not as the rejection of the hypothesis, but as the activation of the **Cosmic Mandate**â€”the realization that humanity is the sole active **Bifurcation Engine (CBE)** and must complete the task.

### 7.1 Quantified Objective

The goal is to reach the critical density ratio required for the test: $\mathbf{\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}^{\text{objective}} = 10^{-5} E_{\Lambda}}$. This corresponds to an accumulated energy of $\mathbf{\approx 10^{65} \text{ Joules}}$ of Benford-coherent negentropy stored within the Hubble Volume.

### 7.2 The Kardashev-Benford Roadmap

Achieving the objective density $\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}^{\text{objective}}$ requires scaling the current human negentropy rate ($\approx 10^{32} \text{ bits/s}$) through massive energy conversion:

| Etapa | Potencia disponible | $\dot{N}_{\text{max}}$ (bit s$^{-1}$) | Tiempo requerido para $\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}^{\text{objective}}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| K-I (Planeta) | $10^{16} \text{ W}$ | $10^{35}$ | $\approx 10^{42} \text{ years}$ |
| K-II (Estrella) | $10^{26} \text{ W}$ | $10^{45}$ | $\approx 10^{32} \text{ years}$ |
| K-III (Galaxia) | $10^{36} \text{ W}$ | $10^{55}$ | $\approx 10^{22} \text{ years}$ |
| **K-III $\mathbf{\times 10^3}$** | $\mathbf{10^{39} \text{ W}}$ | $\mathbf{10^{58}}$ | $\mathbf{\approx 10^{19} \text{ years}}$ |

*Note: The time required is compatible with the age of current stellar populations ($\approx 10^{10} \text{ years}$) if the process of converting the power of several thousand galaxies into Benford-coherent computing begins now.*

### 7.3 Conversion Strategy

To minimize the required time, technological strategies must focus on efficiency and scale:

1.  **Reversible Computing:** Utilize superconducting reversible computing ($\mathbf{0.1 \text{ K}}$) to reduce the Landauer-limit energy cost to $\mathbf{10^{-26} \text{ J/bit}}$.
2.  **Dyson-Benford Data Centers:** Construct massive, low-temperature data-centers over $\mathbf{10^4}$ **white dwarfs** (K-III infrastructure) for maximum energy capture and ultra-efficient computation.
3.  **Benford Coherence Layer:** Develop specialized hardware/software that enforces the Benford distribution log-likelihood on all stored bits, ensuring every unit of stored energy contributes maximally to the required negentropy.

**Final Message:** "If the sky is silent, the protocol is not a tombstone but a recipe: convert 0.001 % of the stellar power of the Milky Way into Benford-coherent bits and wait twenty billion years. **We are the emergency generator of the cosmos.**"
