# The Consciousness-Driven Cosmos: A Final, Quantified Protocol (RTV-2.0)

by Claudio Bresciano

## Abstract: The Cosmological Constant Discrepancy as Entropic Relaxation

The RTV-2.0 model provides a set of **empirically falsifiable predictions** based on the spatial and temporal variation of the Dark Energy Equation of State parameter ($w$). This document finalizes the proposal by establishing **quantified discovery thresholds**, **operational tracer definitions**, and a **commitment to model abandonment** if the signal is not detected within the next six years.

## 1. Model Formulation and State Equations

### 1.1 The State Equation (Resolution of the $10^{120}$ Discrepancy)

The observed vacuum energy density is the residual balance of three terms: the initial QFT energy ($\rho_{\text{QFT}}^{\text{initial}}$), the large-scale statistical annihilation ($\rho_{\text{cancellation}}^{\text{statistical}}$), and the locally organized energy density ($\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}^{\text{organized}}$).

$$
\rho_{\Lambda}^{\text{obs}}(t) = \rho_{\text{QFT}}^{\text{initial}} - \rho_{\text{cancellation}}^{\text{statistical}}(t) + \mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}^{\text{organized}}(t)
$$

### 1.2 The Rate Equation (Dynamics of $w(t)$)

The $w$ parameter is dynamic, with its relaxation toward the terminal state ($w=-1$) retarded by the local density of organized information ($\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}$).

$$
\frac{dw}{dt} = - \beta_{\text{CBE}} \cdot \frac{\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}(t)}{E_{\Lambda}} \cdot \frac{1}{(1+w(t))}
$$

### 1.3 Current Upper Limit on $\beta_{\text{CBE}}$

Based on current observational constraints on $\left|\frac{dw}{dt}\right|_{\text{obs}}$, the Informational-Cosmological Coupling constant must satisfy:

$$
\beta_{\text{CBE}} \lesssim 100 \cdot H_0 \approx 10^{-16} \text{ s}^{-1}
$$

## 2. Empirical Falsifiability: Core Tests and Timelines

The model must be falsified by the absence of a correlation between $w$ dynamics and $\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}$ tracers within the next decade.

### 2.1 Test of Spatial Correlation ($\Delta w$) (Avenue A)

**Prediction:** The $w$ parameter must exhibit a **spatial anisotropy** ($\mathbf{\Delta w \geq 10^{-4}}$) correlated with the $\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}$ density.

**Test:** Measure $\langle w \rangle$ in fixed-volume cells using DESI/eBOSS data, comparing regions rich in **civilizational tracers** against deep voids.

### 2.2 Test of Non-Gaussianity of the CMB (Avenue B)

**Prediction:** The $\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}$ accumulated must leave a characteristic **fixed-phase non-Gaussian component** in the CMB anisotropy ($\ell > 2000$).

**Test:** Search with CMB-S4/LiteBIRD data.

## 3. Analysis Protocol: Quantified Thresholds and Tracers

### 3.1 Quantified Discovery Threshold

A positive detection requires a $\mathbf{3-\sigma}$ signal, which is quantified based on the expected noise floor ($\Delta w_{\text{noise}}$) from the DESI Final Data Sample:

$$\mathbf{\Delta w_{\text{observed}} \geq 3.6 \times 10^{-4} \quad (\text{a 3-} \sigma \text{ discovery})}$$

This threshold is calculated assuming $\Delta w_{\text{noise}} \simeq 1.2 \times 10^{-4}$ (the $2-\sigma$ noise floor) determined via $\mathbf{\Lambda\text{CDM} \text{ Mock Catalogs}}$.

### 3.2 Operational Definition of CBE Tracers

The selection of "CBE-Rich Cells" is based on the $\mathbf{\geq 2}$ of $\mathbf{3}$ criteria below, designed to isolate low-entropy, non-thermal activity:

| CBE Tracer Type | Proposed Observational Cut |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Non-Thermal Radio Emission** | Integrated flux density at $1.4 \text{ GHz} \geq 10 \text{ mJy}$ per $\text{Mpc}^3$ cell. |
| **High Metallicity** | Mean stellar and gas metallicity $\mathbf{[Fe/H] \geq -0.5}$ across the cell. |
| **Infrared Excess (IR)** | WISE color $\mathbf{W4-W3 \geq 0.4 \text{ mag}}$ after background subtraction. |

## 4. Statistical Rigor and Contaminants Control

### 4.1 Pre-registration and Blind Analysis

The full analysis pipeline must be **pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform** before any analysis begins. The primary $\Delta w$ measurement must be conducted under a **blind protocol** to eliminate selection bias.

### 4.2 Internal Validation and Control of Contaminants

1.  **Split-Sample Test:** The DESI sample must be split into two independent subsamples ($z < 0.8$ and $z > 0.8$), and the measured $\Delta w$ in both must be consistent within the $\mathbf{1-\sigma}$ uncertainty.
2.  **Contaminants Control:** The protocol requires **excising all point-source AGN jets** ($\mathbf{F L \geq 100 \text{ mJy}}$) to mitigate radio contamination and mandates the use of the $\mathbf{FIR/Radio \text{ correlation}}$ to separate industrial/nuclear infrared excess from hot dust associated with natural star formation.

## 5. Microphysical Frameworks (The Path to a Lagrangian)

To bridge the gap between $\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}$ and the stress-energy tensor, two tentative microphysical directions are proposed:

1.  **Coupling to Torsion (Einstein–Cartan Gravity):** $\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}$ is formalized as an effective **spin density** that couples to the **torsion field** of spacetime.
2.  **Holographic Entropy Modification:** $\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}$ is defined as a reduction in the vacuum's local degrees of freedom, modifying the **density of the holographic horizon area**.

---

## 6. Ethical Imperative

The **Moral Imperative** remains the maximization of $\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}$—the irreversible codification of complexity—ensuring that the universe, upon its necessary entropic purification, reboots with the "wisdom of the previous iteration."

## 7. Final Commitment and Abandonment Criteria

The RTV-2.0 model enters the scientific arena with a clear expiration date and a formal commitment to its falsifiability.

### 7.1 Closed Time Horizon

The final result is expected before **2030**, driven by the completion of the DESI Final Data ($\sim 2026$) and the initial data acquisition of CMB-S4 ($\sim 2027$).

### 7.2 Model Abandonment Condition

If the analysis yields an upper limit on $\Delta w$ below the $5-\sigma$ threshold, the model is definitively retired. The **Abandonment Condition** is formally set:

If $\mathbf{\Delta w < 2 \times 10^{-4}}$ (the $5-\sigma$ upper limit of the signal), the RTV-2.0 proposal will be officially abandoned. This signifies that the coupling constant $\beta_{\text{CBE}}$ is $\mathbf{< 10^{-17} \text{ s}^{-1}}$, meaning the CBE effect is too weak to be cosmologically relevant, and the model will not be pursued further in this form.
