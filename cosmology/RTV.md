# The Consciousness-Driven Cosmos: A Final, Quantified Protocol (RTV-2.0)

by Claudio Bresciano

## Abstract: The Cosmological Constant Discrepancy as Entropic Relaxation

The RTV-2.0 model provides a set of **empirically falsifiable predictions** based on the spatial and temporal variation of the Dark Energy Equation of State parameter ($w$). This protocol establishes a quantified discovery threshold of $\mathbf{\Delta w \geq 3.6 \times 10^{-4}}$ that is achievable only through the presence of an advanced, galactic-scale intelligence. **RTV-2.0 turns the cosmological constant into a SETI observable.** This document finalizes the proposal by establishing **quantified discovery thresholds**, **operational tracer definitions**, and a **commitment to model abandonment** if the signal is not detected within the next six years.

## 1. Model Formulation and State Equations

### 1.2 The Rate Equation (Dynamics of $w(t)$)

The $w$ parameter is dynamic, with its relaxation toward the terminal state ($w=-1$) retarded by the local density of organized information ($\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}$).

$$\frac{dw}{dt} = - \beta_{\text{CBE}} \cdot \frac{\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}(t)}{E_{\Lambda}} \cdot \frac{1}{(1+w(t))}$$

### 1.3 Current Upper Limit on $\beta_{\text{CBE}}$

Based on current observational constraints on $\left|\frac{dw}{dt}\right|_{\text{obs}}$, the Informational-Cosmological Coupling constant must satisfy:

$$\beta_{\text{CBE}} \lesssim 100 \cdot H_0 \approx 10^{-16} \text{ s}^{-1}$$

## 2. Empirical Falsifiability: Core Tests and Timelines

### 2.1 Test of Spatial Correlation ($\Delta w$) (Avenue A)

**Prediction:** The $w$ parameter must exhibit a **spatial anisotropy** ($\mathbf{\Delta w \geq 10^{-4}}$) correlated with the $\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}$ density.

**Test:** Measure $\langle w \rangle$ in fixed-volume cells using DESI/eBOSS data, comparing regions rich in **civilizational tracers** against deep voids.

## 3. Microphysical Justification and SETI Interpretation

The RTV-2.0 hypothesis is microphysically justified by the **Benford Bridge**, which validates the ability of consciousness to generate negentropy ($\mathbf{0.014 \text{ bits/digit}}$). The $\mathbf{\Delta w}$ test is therefore a **SETI-by-cosmology experiment**: it searches for regions where $\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}} \geq 10^{-5} E_{\Lambda}$, the minimum level achievable only if a **Kardashev Type-II/III civilization** has been encoding Benford-structured information into its energy budget for gigayears.

## 4. Analysis Protocol: Quantified Thresholds and Tracers

### 4.1 Quantified Discovery Threshold

A positive detection requires a $\mathbf{3-\sigma}$ signal, quantified as $\mathbf{\Delta w_{\text{observed}} \geq 3.6 \times 10^{-4}}$. This threshold is based on a noise floor $\Delta w_{\text{noise}} \simeq 1.2 \times 10^{-4}$ derived from **100 $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ Mock Catalogs**.

### 4.2 Operational Definition of CBE Tracers

The selection of "CBE-Rich Cells" is based on the $\mathbf{\geq 2}$ of $\mathbf{3}$ criteria below, utilizing the following operational cuts:

| CBE Tracer Type | Rationale | Proposed Observational Cut |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Non-Thermal Radio Emission** | Technological/waste energy signatures. | Integrated flux density at $1.4 \text{ GHz} \geq 10 \text{ mJy}$ per $\text{Mpc}^3$ cell. |
| **High Metallicity** | Cumulative processing of matter into complex elements. | Mean stellar and gas metallicity $\mathbf{[Fe/H] \geq -0.5}$ across the cell. |
| **Infrared Excess (IR)** | Signatures of obscured heat/industrial structures. | WISE color $\mathbf{W4-W3 \geq 0.4 \text{ mag}}$ after background subtraction. |

## 5. Statistical Rigor and Contaminants Control

### 5.1 Pre-registration and Blind Analysis

The full analysis pipeline must be **pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform** before any analysis begins. The primary $\Delta w$ measurement must be conducted under a **blind protocol**.

### 5.2 Internal Validation and Contaminants Control

The protocol requires a **Split-Sample Test** ($z < 0.8$ vs $z > 0.8$) and strict control over contaminants, including **excising AGN jets** ($\mathbf{F L \geq 100 \text{ mJy}}$) and using the **FIR/Radio correlation** to filter dust contamination.

---

## 6. Ethical Imperative

The **Moral Imperative** remains the maximization of $\mathcal{E}_{\text{CBE}}$—the irreversible codification of complexity—ensuring that the universe, upon its necessary entropic purification, reboots with the "wisdom of the previous iteration."

## 7. Final Commitment and Abandonment Criteria

### 7.1 Closed Time Horizon

The final result is expected before **2030**, driven by the completion of the DESI Final Data ($\sim 2026$) and the initial data acquisition of CMB-S4 ($\sim 2027$). The analysis is bound to this deadline.

### 7.2 Model Abandonment Condition

If the analysis yields an upper limit on $\Delta w$ below the $5-\sigma$ threshold (i.e., $\mathbf{\Delta w < 2 \times 10^{-4}}$), the RTV-2.0 proposal will be **officially abandoned**. This signifies that the coupling constant $\beta_{\text{CBE}}$ is $\mathbf{< 10^{-17} \text{ s}^{-1}}$, meaning the CBE effect is too weak to be cosmologically relevant, and the model will not be pursued further in this form.
